## About
This repository holds all the activities for my Applications for IoT class.


## Frameworks
* Thonny (MicroPython)
* Arduino IDE (C/C++)

## Programming boards used
- Raspberry Pi Pico
- Raspberry Pi Pico W
- Arduino Uno
- Arduino Nano

## Tools
- Get [Thonny](https://thonny.org/) for editing and uploading MicroPython and get the U2F files for your respective Raspberry Pi Pico model [here](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/micropython.html).
- Get the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) for editing the files and upload the sketches onto the Arduino board. Alternatively, you can use [Platform.IO extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=platformio.platformio-ide) (which is how I created and edited these sketches).
